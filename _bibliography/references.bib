abstract = {Although smartphone-based notifications offer a promising tool to support patient engagement and data collection via mobile health apps, attention must be given to the burden caused by frequent notifications and notification timing. This study presents a personalized mobile notification scheme, designed and developed to optimize reachability, and thus data collection from patients. Engineers, psychologists, oncologists, and patients were involved in various stages of a co-design approach and the presented implementation is currently used in the context of a clinical study.},
